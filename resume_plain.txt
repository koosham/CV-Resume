WORK EXPERIENCE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Missouri S&T, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rolla, MO
Graduate Research Assistant
Aug. 2012 - Present
* Developed reliability and interdependency models for smart grids. These analytical models help in identifying vulnerabilities and reducing service interruptions in modern electrical grid.
* Made an ultra-low-power VLF signal detector for underwater communications extending battery life of transceivers by a factor of 40.

Kalscott Eng., Lawrence, KS
Software/Hardware Development Intern
May 2016 - Aug. 2016
* Reduced power consumption of a UAV navigation system to one thirtieth of its original value and improved its performance by 40% by migrating real-time applications to a Linux-powered single-board computer and utilizing optimized algorithms.

Intellispeak LLC, Lawrence, KS
Full-Stack Development Intern And Co-Op
May 2015 - May 2016
* Utilized Bluetooth beacons and constructed an information network to help patients with autism.
* Responsible for developing and testing an embedded firmware application for a GPS tracker with secure communications.

Kalscott Eng., Lawrence, KS
Software/Hardware Development Intern
May 2014 - Aug. 2014
* Developed an automated air-band radio for UAVs. This system is able to predict intent of UAVs with 98% accuracy and inform nearby traffic.

Beh-Azmoon, Isfahan, Iran
Firmware Engineer
Dec. 2011 - Jun. 2012
