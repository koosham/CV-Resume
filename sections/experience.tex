      \begin{cvitems}
        \item Developed reliability and interdependency models for smart grids. These analytical models help in identifying vulnerabilities and reducing service interruptions in modern electrical grid.
        \item Made an ultra-low-power VLF signal detector for underwater communications extending battery life of transceivers by a factor of 40.
        %\item Proposed a model for analysis of interdependencies in cyber-physical systems.
        %\item Graded homework and examinations for \emph{Digital Networks Design} course (CpE-319).
